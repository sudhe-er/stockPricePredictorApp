This Project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Apple Company(AAPL) using a dataset containing various features and attributes related to that company. By analyzing the data, modelled a Deep Learning model that foreacasts the future stock prices of Apple Inc. accurately.
## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project consists of information about different . It includes a wide range of features that can potentially influence the stock price of a company, such as the Open, High, Low, Date, Close and other relevant factors.
## Objective
The main objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a robust predictive model for stock price estimation. By training the model on historical data and leveraging its learned patterns and relationships, it has well predicted stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) company of 60 days accurately.
## Approach
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Techniques such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables will be employed to prepare the dataset for model training. Here LSTM, a ANN model is  evaluated to determine the most suitable model for accurate price prediction.
## Impact
Accurate Stock price prediction can have significant implications for various stakeholders, including newbies who are setting theri minds to invest in what companys, sellers, real estate agents, and investors. With an effective predictive model, prospective buyers can make informed decisions about property investments, sellers can set competitive prices, and agents can provide better guidance to their clients. Additionally, investors can use the predicted prices to identify profitable opportunities in the stock market.

Through this project, insights and patterns in the Stock market can be uncovered, allowing for a better understanding of the factors influencing Stock prices and facilitating more informed decision-making in the Stock Market industry.
